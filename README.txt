pyQP module for quadratic optimization problem.

This is a simple swig package of Quadprog++ (http://quadprog.sourceforge.net/).
Some modifications have been done on the source code to be compatible with
the swig procedure. A simple example is presented to show how to use the
package.

To install this package, you need numpy, swig, g++ (and python-dev?).
then, open a terminal and run:

  python setup.py install

or

  python setup.py install --user

if you have no administration rights.
